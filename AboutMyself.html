<h1>About Myself: Sadhana Sridhar</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Sadhana Sridhar. I am currently thirteen years old as of 20th October, 2022. My birthday is on Novemeber 12th. This is my second website, the first being about books. I live in Chennai and go to a school called KC High which stands for Kid Central. I live in Besant Nagar with my Mom, Dad, Paternal grandparents and dog. My dog is a shih tzu and is currently three years old. </p>

<p>I was born on November 12th, 2008 in Chennai. I then moved to Singapore and lived there for five years before moving back to Chennai. After another five years I moved to Pune. However, I lived there for two to three months before moving back to Chennai. In Chennai I go to the school KC High which is located in Navalur. I am currently in the 8th Grade. </p>

<p>Some things I like to do are reading, music (singing, listening, playing the guitar and piano), travelling, anything to do with eating food and playing with my dog. Some of my favourite artists I love are Adele, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Olivia Rodrigo, Calum Scott and more.<p>Some of my favourite books and series are: <ol>
    <li>Keeper of the Lost Cities</li>
    <li>Harry Potter</li>
    <li>More to the Story</li>
    <li>Percy Jackson</li>
  </ol>  
  </p> Some of the places that I have loved travelling to are Singapore, Australia and London. I love sweet food such as brownies and anything to do with caramel. Savoury food that I like is mostly anything that contains chicken. </p>
